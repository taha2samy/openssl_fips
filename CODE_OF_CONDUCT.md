# Community Principles: Wolfi OpenSSL FIPS

This is a community project built by everyone, for everyone. We believe in high-security, open collaboration, and humble work. There are no "members" or "leaders" here—we are all contributors working toward a safer cloud.

## 01. The Vibe
*   **Zero Egos:** We are all here to learn and build. No matter your experience level, your contribution is valued.
*   **Serious Tech:** Cryptography is serious business. We keep our discussions focused on security, integrity, and performance.
*   **Mutual Respect:** Treat others like brothers. Be helpful, be patient, and keep the environment clean.

## 02. How we work together
*   **Collaborate Freely:** If you see something that can be better, open a PR or start a discussion. The project is open for anyone to improve.
*   **Be Straightforward:** We like clear, honest, and technical feedback. If something is broken, say it. If something is good, support it.
*   **Help the Newcomers:** If someone is starting out, give them a hand. We were all beginners once.

## 03. Keeping it Clean
We are a professional, serious community. Any behavior that is disrespectful, toxic, or meant to distract from our technical goals has no place here. We fix things with a simple conversation; we are here for the code, not the drama.

## 04. Our Goal
To provide the world with a transparent, FIPS-validated, and highly secure OpenSSL foundation. We do this together, **"على الله"**.
